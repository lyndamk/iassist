Our primary collaboration has been with Digital Divide Data (DDD), a company based in India, Cambodia, Laos, and Kenya that provides youth development through education and employment programs to underserved communities. DDD provides students with paid positions that give them the opportunity to learn how to interpret and clean survey data, skills which they then use in their educational and career pursuits. Through joint efforts with DDD, Roper has been able to target the conversion of over 600 of our historical ASCII datasets to modern formats as well as processing of over 100,000 questions from toplines incoming daily for entry into our question-level iPoll database. This presentation will provide an overview of our ASCII conversion and question-level curation projects, DDD and their mission, our training and review processes, and potential future projects.</p>"
x,Alisa Rod,Meghan Goodchild,,,,,CESSDA Data Catalogue and ELSST integration,"<p>CESSDA Data Catalogue (CDC) contains descriptions of more than 40,000 data collections held by CESSDA&rsquo;s Service Providers (SP), originating from over 20 European countries. The descriptions follow the DDI metadata standard and are harvested through OAI-PMH from the SPs. A central way of discovering data collections in the CDC is through the use of keywords. Many SPs use CESSDAs own thesaurus for the social sciences, European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), for keywords. ELSST aims to cover all relevant research subjects within the social science and consists of over 3,300 concepts available in 16 languages through an interactive webservice.</p>
<p>In order to increase data discoverability, and fully utilize the structure of ELSST, we wanted to integrate CDC and ELSST. An important part was to maintain the user friendly UI of CDC, and at the same time support the complexities of ELSST. As a solution for this, the integration between the two services are done using API lookups of relevant metadata elements, presenting themselves as links for the user. Whenever a user discovers a data collection in CDC, there is a check to find out if a given keyword describing the data collection exists as a concept in ELSST. If this is the case, a link to the concept in ELSST is generated. The link will take the user to the concept in ELSST, where the user can read more about the concept and navigate through the thesaurus structure. From ELSST the user can directly search for data collections in the CDC marked with concepts the user discovers.</p>
<p>The integration between the services is both simple and powerful. It enhances the functionality of both with regards to data discovery at the same time avoiding introduction of unnecessary complexities.</p>"
x,Alison Sizer,,,,,,Venturing Beyond our Silos:  Results from a Survey of Canadian Data Repository Administrators,"<p>The academic library community has a long history of collaboration demonstrated by the global adoption of common standards in our work. Despite the widespread use of the same standards and platforms, too few examples exist of academic libraries navigating beyond silos to shared infrastructure and services. As the scope of academic libraries grows to support research data as part of the scholarly resources that we steward, is it possible to develop shared research data management (RDM) services and infrastructures collaboratively? Six years have passed since a recommendation was made by Canada's national research library association to establish a national data repository that would provide a robust, scalable, and affordable shared service. Building a national repository together would harness available but limited and distributed expertise in RDM, and encourage the collective creation and reuse of materials supporting training, user support, and outreach. Since 2019, Borealis began formally offering the service nationally, governed in partnership with regional academic library consortia, which now supports over 70 Canadian institutions, each managing a locally-branded collection and providing local support to researchers.<br><br>Has this push for greater equity been realized by Borealis and what are the experiences of its institutional administrators? This presentation reports the results of a community-led survey of Canada's Borealis administrators, focusing on their individual perspectives on challenges, barriers, and needs of the emerging community. Overall, the results of the survey highlight a unique effort to build equitable data sharing infrastructure that is national in scope and reflective of community needs. Understanding both the infrastructure demands and the needs for support from our community provides insights on how to plan future programs and software development initiatives. Learning from our experiences and our community can benefit other national and international large-scale repository initiatives in charting the future of data.</p>"

<p><strong><em>The SVTP project: </em></strong>Virtual Surveys for Tourism</p>
<p>by Flavio Bonifacio</p>
<p><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong></p>
<p>There are now problems interviewing people by phone, even for simple and short interviews.&nbsp; This for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Inflation of commercial and/or promotional interviews</li>
<li>&nbsp;The decrease in the number of landline phones</li>
<li>Connecting people via mobile phone due to the absence of public directories of telephone numbers is extremely expensive.</li>
</ol>
<p>The SVTP project aims to reduce these difficulties by the construction of an answering machine. The machine will learn to answer from previous experiences, from surveys already conducted on subjects of interest (tourism in our case).</p>
<p>The project we will work on a panel of tourism surveys to create a virtual survey campaign by means of the automated answering machine.</p>
<p>The proposed machine will be able to answer survey questions.</p>
<p>We have already done 10 surveys in years 20,21,22,23 about tourism in Piedmont for the local administration. Three for Sommers, three for Autumns, three for Winter and one for testing purpose (Autumn 23)</p>
<p>We have already built a base line automated survey from the previous nine surveys and&nbsp;compared the answers of this survey on the test survey (Autumn 23) which results will be presented.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several simulation trials using different forecasting techniques will be done: logistic regression and decisional trees for example.</p>
<p>The models test will compare the model results with the baseline model to better preview the number of future Piedmont tourist visitors. The results of the test will be presented.</p>
<p>Something like what ChatGPT does building artificial questionnaires, just to give an example. We will generate the answers instead.</p>
<p>Philosophic implications of all of this are obvious. I will give you some clues in the presentation.</p>

As two independent organizations, we intend to share information and in the future create an age-specific portal to allow comparisons across international borders, making it easier for researchers to find relevant data quickly, while supporting data harmonization, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse. Since the researcher journey broadly begins at a high level, then drills down to find the most appropriate variables, we propose to create a proof of concept at a conceptual group level.<br><br>The use of metadata standards and collaboration are essential for providing researchers with these infrastructures. Since both CLOSER Discovery and NACDA portals operate with metadata documented using the DDI metadata standard, we can leverage this in an interoperable way, without recreating efforts.<br><br>This PPT was presented at the annual IASSIST conference in 2024 to show how we have built a collaboration and will outline the likely approach to cross-country discoverability and best practice. The PPT consists of 27 slides.&nbsp;</p>"
x,Ben Chiewphasa,,,,,,Moving from project to infrastructure,"<p>CLOSER is the interdisciplinary partnership of leading UK social and biomedical longitudinal population studies, the UK Data Service and The British Library. Evolving from a project to a sustainable infrastructure presents a variety of challenges at all levels both within an organisation, and for its collaborators. The presentation will reflect on these challenges from the perspective of CLOSER and more generally within a university environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Areas covered will include creating structures and processes which support the long term, staff development and training, the development of software and changes in technology to support these organisational changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presentation will also draw some lessons that could be more widely useful from this case study.</p>"
x,Beth Knazook,Erin Clary,Mikala Narlock,,,,De Facto Data Librarian? How Business Librarians' Data Skills Support the Future of Library Data Services,"<p>As we plot the future of data services in libraries, the interdisciplinary nature of data services means that increasing collaboration between functional data librarians and subject liaison librarians is a key trend. As well, subject liaison librarians are learning new skills and recognizing existing literacies to better serve their user populations. An example of this is data skils inherent to business librarianship. Business librarians are pragmatic data librarians, often not recognizing the extent of their data skills and abilities to provide data services. Especially in workplaces without specialist or standalone data librarians, business and economics librarians often function also as the de facto data librarian, handling data reference questions without additional support. The diverse, complex nature of business information means that business librarians have a significant ability to support patrons as they navigate siloed data, search for free data sources, and build datasets when no existing source is readily available.</p>
<p>This presentation will focus on how business librarians&rsquo; data skills complement services provided by functional data librarians, and how business librarians already have many of the skills to meet patrons&rsquo; data needs in the absence of specialist support. From their experiences as business librarians and examples from the literature, the presenters will lay out basic strengths and challenges data librarians or service coordinators can anticipate from building partnerships with business librarians. In particular, the session will present the value business librarians can bring to data sourcing, data synthesis, and incorporating data alongside other information sources. Presenters will also identify intervention points where data experts can support business librarians, in areas such as data visualization, alternative data sourcing, and systematic approaches to data literacy.</p>"
x,Brian Jackson,,,,,,'Wealth from the Sea': Finding Treasures in a Database of Social Science Data-linked Literature,"<p>The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), a social and behavioral research data archive, maintains the ICPSR Bibliography of Data-related Literature. Initially created with the support of a National Science Foundation grant in 1999, the Bibliography captures and documents the usage of ICPSR data in research and publications. It helps people discover data and gauge its potential utility. Now housing over 110,000 data-linked citations, the Bibliography&rsquo;s database continues to be expanded by librarians and information professionals who actively fish through research output, both published and unpublished, to find instances of ICPSR data usage. If a publication meets the Bibliography&rsquo;s collection criteria, the publication is displayed with the research study&rsquo;s record on ICPSR&rsquo;s websites. By equipping people with a compass to discover and evaluate the value of the thousands of social science datasets held by ICPSR, the Bibliography provides &ldquo;wealth from the sea&rdquo; of data.</p>"
x,Briana Wham,Sheridan Shannon,,,,,A panorama of self-deposit practices in European and North American archives,"<p>This paper analyses self-deposit operations in European and North American archives. By examining the obstacles to the introduction of self-deposit services stricto sensu (with minimum involvement of the data stewards), which are still rare, this research looks closely at how data stewards support the curation and documentation effort that must be handled, at least partially, by the depositors themselves. Our analysis shows that self-deposit practices are a trend that is particularly marked in emerging archives.</p>
<p>Very few studies tackled this subject head-on: how are curation practices actually carried out? What are the various costs involved? What types of guidelines are provided to depositors? How are the archive's recommendations and instructions accepted and followed by depositors? To what extent is the data re-use potential taken into account when it comes to self-deposit?&nbsp; While some of these questions have been addressed in the literature, albeit in very general terms, there is very little concrete feedback out there. This is the subject our paper tackles.</p>
<p>Empirically, our research is based on 20&nbsp; interviews (an in-depth questionnaire and/or guided interviews conducted remotely) conducted, between 2021 and 2022, with CESSDA archives or repositories referenced by the Dataverse network.</p>
<p>In this paper, we will analyse several pitfalls in the implementation of open science policies: the difficulties in finding the right balance between the archive's workflows and the flexibility granted to depositors; the gap between the limited resources that data curation teams have and the extent of the tasks that ultimately fall on them to make data FAIR; the uncertainties over the modes of reasoned division of labour that can be put in place between depositors, data stewards and other data professionals, to optimise the self deposit workflow and the articulation deficit between self-deposit practices and the data re-use potential.</p>"

<p>Members of the Data Collection Development Interest Group will share their efforts to implement and enhance the existing acquisitions infrastructure at their institutions, and will share their thoughts on the challenges they have confronted in their quest to add research data to their libraries&rsquo; collections. The panelists will cover licensing &amp; curation, data storage &amp; access, identifying vendors &amp; key players within their institution and evaluating data quality.</p>"
x,Caden Picard,jay winkler,,,,,Charting a course towards coordinated research data services,"<p>Due to the growth of funder and journal policies, researchers across all disciplines are increasingly required to manage data in accordance with requirements related to data management planning and data deposit. Canadian academic institutions that are eligible to administer federal research funding were also required to create an institutional research data management strategy this past year (as described in the Tri-Agency RDM policy). As a result, academic institutions need to develop strategic, coordinated approaches to providing research data services, in order to avoid siloed and inefficient duplication of services across campus and potential gaps in programming and support. This presentation will compare and contrast the efforts of two Canadian university libraries who are participating in the Ithaka S+R initiative &ldquo;Building Campus Strategies for Coordinated Data Support,&rdquo; a cohort-based project with 29 universities across Canada and the US. Based on analyses of research data services currently offered and the experiences of researchers in navigating and accessing existing services, the presenters will explore various topics, including the types of services currently offered at these two institutions, the roles various service providers play (e.g., library, research office, IT), and the areas identified as opportunities for future investment. Other topics will include potential mechanisms of coordinating and collaborating to develop and offer effective research data services and the various opportunities for leveraging regional or national services and infrastructure. Given the relevance of research data services and research data management for institutions broadly, the questions and issues discussed will be of interest to IASSIST attendees regardless of geographic location.</p>"
x,Carissa Phillips,,,,,,Participatory Mapping and Historical Memory: Reconstructing Destroyed Villages of the Salvadoran Civil War,"<p>This presentation examines the use of participatory mapping and historical GIS to reconstruct communities destroyed during the Salvadoran Civil War. These reconstructions serve as both a repository of living memory and an access point to a growing body of archival evidence and testimonials collected by the surviving memory team. This work incorporates precision GPS equipment, and Survey 123 to record data from survivor testimonials and physical evidence, alongside historical maps, and archival imagery. It briefly discusses the data collection workflows and tools and introduces a trauma-informed approach to participatory mapping in an historical memory context and how these approaches can be applied across multiple projects in different contexts. Finally, it shows how the resulting interactive maps become powerful tools for knowledge mobilization and to support more in-depth reconstructions of communities lost to scorched-earth tactics.</p>

A primary purpose of these decennial censuses &ndash; to serve as a basis for calculation of resource allocation across areas &ndash; has remained, but the data collected has grown in detail complexity, giving a richer population profile snapshot. The most recent E&amp;W census, in 2021, may be the last if the government deems alternative, more cost-effective and/or accurate methods of data collection are available.See https://consultations.ons.gov.uk/ons/futureofpopulationandmigrationstatistics/</p>
<p>Ending census data collection would affect the future of E&amp;W&rsquo;s largest longitudinal nationally representative data resource, the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (LS). The LS comprises linked census and life events data for a 1% sample of the population of E&amp;W from 1971 onwards, with individuals of all ages becoming members if they have one of four undisclosed birthdays. It enables researchers to track members over the life course, discovering the impacts of an individual&rsquo;s personal, social and environmental circumstances on their outcomes, including changes in their travel to work.</p>
<p>How we travel is inextricably linked to human and wider planetary health. Understanding what steers individuals&rsquo; travel behaviours in future is central to informing transport policy that will protect human health through, for example, climate change adaptation and pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>In our dual roles as members of the Centre for Longitudinal Study Information and User Support (CeLSIUS) team, and as researchers, we demonstrate the power of the LS, presenting our ongoing investigation of commuting behaviour and associated factors &ndash; such as self-rated health, socioeconomic status, length of commute, residential and workplace stability, and neighbourhood walkability &ndash; among LS members. We highlight the implications of the proposed cessation of the census and discuss data sources needed to interpret future commuting habits.</p>"

At McMaster University, the rare maps collection is held on a different level to the Map Library, which makes moving maps for teaching, reference, and assessment even more challenging. Although the utilization of a map cart would be the apparent solution, such a tool is not readily accessible for procurement from library/archival supplies vendors. This is the predicament that confronted McMaster&rsquo;s Map Library when looking to undertake a series of collection management projects. In this presentation, we detail the steps taken and lessons learned in creating a bespoke map cart.</p>"

This research was conducted in 2020 and 2022 with participants from programs across the University of Manitoba (UM) to illuminate the landscape of data literacy. This paper will not only delineate the current landscape of data literacy at UM (a Canadian public research university of around 30,000 students) but also explore challenges and potential pathways for improvement.

x,Cody Hennesy,Tim Dennis,Zhiyuan Yao,,,,Physical Linkage vs. Linkage Ready Data Sources,"<p>This talk will discuss approaches for linking different data sets with the goal of offering richer data sources for research. Approach one will make research easier by hosting all datasets in one place and creating one big data source. While this approach benefits from easy handling of data in one place, it also comes with issues like data ownership, data protection, and data documentation/services. Approach two is not demanding one single storage location. Data sets may be stored in different places, but they need to be structured to be &ldquo;Linkage-Ready&rdquo;. Being linkage-ready, or interoperable, demands, beside a useful identifier to link cases, a coordination of research domains, instruments, and universes. The talk will discuss the pros and cons of both approaches based on the current situation regarding the availability of data for research on education and learning in Switzerland.</p>"
x,Dan Gillman,,,,,,Furthering an open science culture at the Swedish University of Agricultural sciences,"<p>Open access to curated research data contributes to spreading of knowledge and to an increased ability for public and private players, as well as private individuals, to contribute to a more sustainable, democratic society and more efficient information exchange.</p>
<p>The routines necessary for open access to research data will not only further &ldquo;good data hygiene&rdquo; among the research community, but also clarify in which situations data is in need of special protection. To achieve this degree of data management, certain levels of routines, standardization and infrastructure are required. In addition to this, a supporting culture and acceptance of the concept is required from researchers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to create the physical, organizational and cultural conditions necessary to make more research data from SLU available according to the FAIR principles. A well-functioning process; from project planning, data acquisition, analysis and storage through to archiving and publication of research results, requires an equally well-functioning collaboration between the functions involved in data management support. It also requires clear routines as well as hard- and software that can connect the different parts of the process. In addition to all this, it depends on researchers and managers gaining an understanding of the value it may generate and a willingness to adapt routines to this.</p>"

The idea of a secure library data archive was floated but despite support from Library Administration and the provision of storage space, we became mired down in endless conversations about procedure, ethics and data ownership. In 2022 an additional data crisis arose: our Research Ethics Board&rsquo;s former recommended option for sharing sensitive data was being decommissioned and an unknown number of potentially restricted datasets were about to become homeless. That was the push needed and in 2023 the Library Secure Data Archive was launched. Come hear a story of data neglect, peculiar storage recommendations and The Form That Took Forever!</p>"
x,Deborah Wiltshire,,,,,,Refactoring data delivery: The case study of the new tools for census flow data at UKDS,"<p>This paper presents the API and user interface for disseminating census flow data developed as part of the UK Data Service (UKDS) strategy to modernise its supported software. It explores the development challenges and the diverse technologies employed, contextualised within the broader scope of data services. The new tools were in the final stages of development at the time of writing.</p>
<p>We opted to construct these tools from the ground up, a decision influenced by the complex nature of the underlying data, which necessitated high levels of flexibility and adaptability. This paper will critically evaluate the decision-making process, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of developing in-house solutions versus the trend of relying on external, often commercial, platforms. Third-party solutions frequently compromise functionality and the ability to tailor to specific requirements, especially when dealing with highly complex data. The presentation will showcase some functionalities of these new tools, highlighting ongoing enhancements, including integrating AI and machine-learning technologies. We will also discuss the advantages of the design principle to separate the user interface from the backend API. This approach improves user experience and promotes better interoperability.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that budget and overall resource constraints are a common hurdle in such initiatives, this case study provides insights into the feasible options available to data services striving to deliver robust and comprehensive data to their users. The insights and experience shared are intended to contribute to the dynamic relationship between data services and information science, especially when dealing with data related to the social sciences. By offering practical examples and lessons learned, we aim to inform those enhancing data accessibility, utility, and distribution in a rapidly evolving digital environment, where data services often face challenges in keeping pace with technological advances.</p>"
x,Dylanne Dearborn,Jasmine Lefresne,Lok Hei Lui,,,,International collaboration as a common approach to improve the FAIRness of non-numeric/ qualitative research data,"<p>The future of sharing and reusing qualitative research materials will be shaped by technological innovations, ethical considerations, privacy and data security issues, collaborative efforts, and an increased focus on improving the <a>rigor</a> and <a>applicability</a>&nbsp; of findings derived from existing non-numeric/qualitative datasets.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitivity and comprehensiveness of the data, the integration of (AI-based) technology in data curation, data sharing and data analysis workflows needs to be carefully addressed, as well as issues of interdisciplinary approaches. Furthermore, researchers from different disciplines will be interested in using qualitative data, and vice versa, qualitative researchers will be interested in using data from other methodological backgrounds that lend themselves to the application of qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>In the face of these developments and challenges, collaboration between data infrastructures with expertise in the curation and provision of qualitative data is key. Networks such as QualidataNet, a community-centered federated network of RDCs, seek to share and discuss common solutions for harmonization and standardization where possible. Its focus is to provide a single point of access to qualitative datasets from different data providers and to promote the sharing and reuse of qualitative data in line with the FAIR Data Principles.</p>
<p>QualidataNet is part of the Consortium for Social, Behavioral, Educational and Economic Sciences (KonsortSWD) at the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) in Germany. It coordinates the international cooperation within the DDI via the DDI-CDI Subgroup ""Non-Numeric, Non-Code Datums"", which aims at a standardized and comprehensive metadata description of data objects to enable cross domain integration.</p>
<p>We will present the current work, future steps and plans of this international effort: In addition, we would like to continue exploring opportunities for international collaboration and exchange, and invite for participation with the goal of shaping FAIR's ways of processing, archiving, and reusing qualitative data objects.</p>

Creating a FAIR Self-Assessment Checklist for Data Repositories,"<p>In 2022, a team from a local grant-funded medical data repository team contacted the University of Pennsylvania Libraries&rsquo; Research Data &amp; Digital Scholarship unit asking for guidance on evaluating the extent that their repository was FAIR enabling. After a consultation with the repository team, our research data experts discovered that many of the current self-assessments of the FAIR guidelines were for data creators rather than data repository managers. In addition, we wanted a self-assessment tool similar to the process and guidance created by CoreTrustSeal but with a focus explicitly on FAIR principles. In answer to their request, the Penn Libraries&rsquo; Research Data Engineer conducted a literature review and coalesced current guidance and assessment tools on the principles. After this review of the existing documentation, a small team consisting of the Research Data Engineer, the Head of Research Data Services, the Director of Data and Innovation Services, and the Bioinformatics Librarian developed through an iterative process a self-assessment tool for repository managers regarding FAIR principles. In addition to several iterations of the tool, we also met with the repository managers for feedback on ways to make the tool more understandable. Our discussions provided insights into the challenges of explaining the FAIR principles to those without information science backgrounds. The discussions we had and the development of this self-assessment tool helped to develop a more transparent and trustworthy repository.<br><br>This presentation will discuss the development of the assessment, the goals for utilizing the tool, and lessons learned. Reporting our findings as they currently stand will prompt the research data management field to ruminate on FAIR principle adoption for data repositories.

<p>The National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) began working with DDI-Lifecycle (DDI-L) in 2018. Since then, NACDA has documented some of its most established and frequently-used longitudinal data collections to DDI-L and displayed them in a Colectica Portal. In this presentation, I will discuss how this portal functions, how our use of the portal has evolved, and our plans for the future. In particular, I will highlight the creation and presentation of single-series cross-wave concordance documentation, concordance documentation for two separate series, and concordance documentation for three or more series.</p>

x,Hanna Lindroos,,,,,,Creating a Transparent and Interoperable Curation Workflow,"<p><span>NYU IT and Data Services launched a new research repository, UltraViolet (made with InvenioRDM), in May 2022. Prior to opening the service, the curation team spent significant time planning and designing a transparent, interoperable workflow. Influenced by the collaborative curation model of the Data Curation Network, including their CURATE(D) steps, the team decided to use shared file and information management systems, with no crucial pieces of communication or tracking left in an individual&rsquo;s email or personal documents. The workflow weaves together several tools, all of which were previously available and familiar to system users. Patrons begin by entering metadata about a deposit in a Qualtrics form, which feeds into Springshare&rsquo;s LibAnswers portal. An available curator responds using a LibAnswers macro and supplies a Globus upload link; the researcher then adds their files. As the curator reviews the files and communicates with the researcher, they can use internal notes and templates in LibAnswers that incorporate DCN CURATE(D) checklists to ensure the curator stays attuned to crucial pieces of the curation workflow and maintains a log our whole team can access. All communication with the researcher (both emails and notes from conversations) also stays in LibAnswers, enabling other curators to pick up or refer back to the conversation. For large data, curators can also use an API to connect Globus directly to UltraViolet. This connection automatically loads data to the appropriate record in UltraViolet, transferring the files to our preservation repository while maintaining an ready access copy. The poster depicts this workflow and points to some future refinements and improvements we hope to make, such as connections with other InvenioRDM tools and automations. </span></p>"

<p>The ONS Longitudinal Study, follows a 1% sample of the England &amp; Wales population from the decennial census data (1971 &ndash; 2011), linked to births, deaths and cancer registration data. Sample members are selected on the basis of four confidential birthdays, with new study members entering the study through birth on one of the four birthdays or immigration (and being born on one of the four birthdays) and leave through death or emigration. The main strength of the LS is its large sample size (&gt;1 million), making it the largest nationally representative dataset in the UK, and allowing the analysis of small areas and specific population groups.</p>
<p>The ONS-LS currently has 46 years of follow-up data 1971 &ndash; 2017, and the upcoming linkage of the 2021 Census data to the Study will extend this follow-up to 2021 enabling researchers to examine changes that have taken place in 2011 &ndash; 2021 period, which saw Brexit and the Covid 19 pandemic. The paper will introduce the data available in the ONS-LS and will discuss its size and scope. The support available to researchers interested in using the ONS-LS in their research from the Centre for Longitudinal Study Information and User Support (CeLSIUS) is also highlighted, as are the arrangements for accessing the data.&nbsp; The presentation also summarises some recent examples of research using the ONS-LS and highlights some key areas for future research. It concludes with a brief introduction of the ONS-LS&rsquo;s sister studies, the Scottish Longitudinal Study and the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study, and the opportunities that these studies offer for comparative research.</p>"

It currently follows a self-deposit model that allows U of T researchers to deposit and publish their data without intervention unless requested. Considering increased usage of the repository and new and developing data deposit policies, we conducted an assessment of U of T Dataverse to (1) review the quality of published datasets, and (2) understand who is using the repository. This was accomplished by analyzing the monthly Borealis metrics and conducting a quality assessment of select datasets&rsquo; structure and associated metadata. Ultimately, this assessment will be used to help conceptualize curation services and identify resources to develop that would enable high-quality data deposits. In this presentation we will discuss our approach to this assessment, preliminary findings, and how this project will shape our approach to service and resource development. Overall, this project will allow us to better understand disciplinary trends relating to who is (and isn&rsquo;t) using U of T Dataverse, help develop clear processes and guidelines, and inform training and departmental outreach. Longer-term, it will help us estimate the effort and time required to provide curation services, inform priorities for repository development, and help us anticipate the impact any change in national policy may have in demand for institutional services.</p>"

This research navigates the realm of urban criminology through a novel lens by integrating geospatial analysis of land use and infrastructure data with sentiment analysis from social media. This work examines how the fabric of urban design influences crime occurrence and public perception. The geospatial component utilizes a comprehensive set of urban data, to map crime hotspots and investigate correlations with urban form. Complementing this, sentiment analysis of social media content offers a pulse on community sentiments towards crime and safety. Despite limitations in geotagged data, innovative natural language processing techniques, respecting ethical and privacy standards, aim to approximate spatial sentiment distributions. This bifocal approach not only highlights areas of concern but also elucidates public response to crime, potentially serving as a barometer for policy impact. The presentation undertakes a deep dive into how data-driven insights can empower data and geospatial professionals within libraries, research, and archives to craft narratives that blend numbers with nuance, aiding in the design of safer, more resilient urban spaces.</span></p>"
,James Mitchell Doiron,,,,,,Mapping a Legacy: Ukrainian Immigration and the Settlement of Western Canada,"<p>Ukrainian Canadians began to settle in western Canada in 1892. Settlement occurred in 'blocks' &ndash;&nbsp;farm-sized quarter sections demarcated by the Dominion Lands Survey. Block settlement allowed the new migrants to settle among family and communities and contributed to the growth of a strong Ukrainian Canadian community. This&nbsp;was initially preferred by immigration and land agents, as it made their work easier, but the practice soon fell out of favour. Despite government opposition, Ukrainians continued to settle in&nbsp;these&nbsp;same&nbsp;patterns, establishing the Ukrainian Canadians as one of main ethnic groups that contributed to the development of the newly established Western Canada and Dominion of Canada.<br><br>This project will use census data along with archival&nbsp;and genealogical&nbsp;documents to create an interactive map showing the movement of Ukrainians to and across Canada throughout their 130-year period of immigration. Most of the demographic information about the history of Ukrainian block settlement is contained in static thematic maps that were published over 30 years ago. With the addition of census data, these maps can be transformed into dynamic and interactive objects.<br><br>This project seeks to preserve the historically significant research on Ukrainian immigrant block settlements with the creation of an openly accessible geospatial resource that includes historic and contemporary census data. This interactive mapping project will be a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and the general public interested in exploring the multifaceted narrative of Ukrainian immigration in Canada.</p>"

,Jennifer Zeiger,,,,,,The best things in life are free but data sharing is not: A multi-institutional study of the realities of academic data sharing,"<p>With increasing requirements to make research data publicly available, it is critical to acknowledge and understand the labor and costs required to meet these obligations. This panel will present results from the Realities of Academic Sharing (RADS) initiative, a mixed-method study across six US Research Universities. Through surveys of and interviews with institutional administrators and federally funded researchers, we assessed engagement with data management and sharing (DMS) activities and the costs associated with this work. We found that institutions support a broad range of DMS activities, and invest an average of $750,000 annually in this support, with the highest costs falling on IT and Libraries. Researchers also engage with DMS activities, although many do so without institutional support. This panel will consist of separate presentations on the various facets of our results, focusing on four different institutional perspectives. First, we will discuss the Libraries, which support the majority of DMS activities across institutions, and bear some of the highest costs for DMS support. Secondly, we will highlight the support and expenses of other administrative offices such as Institutional Technology, Research Offices, and Specialized Centers. These offices are often overlooked as primary DMS service providers, but support a substantial number of DMS activities and bear considerable infrastructural costs. Thirdly, we will present the results for researchers, who spend an average of nearly 6% of their grant award totals on DMS activities, with this value more than doubling for smaller grant awards. Although most report engaging in DMS without institutional support, we found some evidence of cost-savings for those who did engage institutionally. Finally, we will discuss implications for practices and data-informed responses at the individual institution level, as well as invite collaboration in future research to broaden and diversify the institutions represented in this initial study.</p>"

,Jessica Ko,Kelsie Norek,,,,,"Data Reuse Among Digital Humanities Scholars: A Qualitative Study of Practices, Challenges and Opportunities","<div>
<div>
<div><span>Scholarship is more and more data-driven, and as digital tools continue to evolve, sound data use practices among scholars are now essential for scientific discovery. Data reuse is central to an emerging cultural push towards a more open way of doing science. The study investigates the challenges and opportunities in reusing research data among digital humanities (DH) scholars. Its findings may serve as a case study for how disciplinary practices influence the ways in which scholars reuse data. The aim of the study is to enhance current thinking and provide insight for information and library science practitioners at the intersection of DH and data reuse. Data were collected using interviews. An analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 DH scholars working in universities, research centres and cultural and heritage organizations internationally was performed. The study found that lack of time and resources, inconsistent data practices, technical training gaps, labour intensity and difficulties in finding data were the most challenging. Participants revealed a number of enabling factors in data reuse as well, and chief among them were collaboration and autodidacticism as a feature of DH. The results indicate a gap between data reusers and data sharers - low rates of sharing reduce the amount of findable and accessible data available for reuse. Both data reusers and data sharers must begin to see themselves as embedded into the research data lifecycle within the research infrastructure. The recommendation includes policy, education, and structural changes to the research culture, including data literacy, the development of self-paced RDM training material, improvements to data discovery systems, rewarding data sharing, and creation of curation and preservation networks to help with data stewardship. The primary audience for this thesis is DH practitioners, librarians, funders and data repository managers and designers but findings around researcher motivations for data reuse may be helpful for researchers in the humanities and social sciences.</span></div>

,Kate Barron,Ron Nakao,Barbara Esty,Bobray Bordelon,,,The Fashion of Collaboration in Geospatial Data Librarianship: Shaping Emerging Research Data Management Services,"<p>To the best of my knowledge, there has been limited research in the context of geospatial data librarianship into the growing trends in its data services, particularly in regard to research data management services (RDMS) and collaboration trends. While geospatial data is becoming increasingly important in addressing global concerns and enabling a wide range of applications, there is still a gap in understanding how developing RDMS interact with collaborative efforts in the geospatial data librarianship area. These services include the difficult curation, preservation, and accessibility of geospatial datasets, each with its own set of spatial and temporal dimensions. Collaboration emerges as a critical feature at multiple levels within this dynamic ecology. For instance, inter-multidisciplinary collaborations are becoming more important as geospatial data librarians collaborate with researchers from other professions to build tailored RDMS for specific domains. This will ensure that data management strategies fit the specific needs of each profession. Second, intra-institutional interactions within institutions become critical for efficient RDMS, mandating close collaboration between libraries, research centres, IT departments, and cartography units. Such arrangements help to ensure the seamless integration of geospatial data into the academic and research environments, as well as a uniform approach to data stewardship. Finally, cross-sectoral collaborations among academic institutions, government agencies, and industry stakeholders are critical in shaping geospatial data management policies, standards, and practices, fostering advancements in RDMS on regional, national, and international scales. Through an examination of these trends, the absence of research on this topic may reveal the diverse degrees of collaboration inherent in the evolving fashion of geospatial data librarianship as it relates to enabling users access to geospatial data. This, in turn, will foster progressions in the domain of librarianship, geospatial sciences and its extensive pragmatic applications.</p>"

,Kathryn Lavender,Hayley Mills,Jon Johnson,,,,Boosting Data Findability: The Role of AI-Enhanced Keywords,"<p>In today&rsquo;s data-driven world, data has become more valuable than ever. Finding relevant data within a vast expanse of data can be quite challenging at times. Researchers have been working on finding different methods to offer the relevant data to users easily and swiftly. Focusing on data and its reusability, FAIR principles emphasize on the importance of findability of data. Finding the relevant data will make the life of data users easier and at the same time improves the reusability quotient of the data for data producer.</p>
<p>For data archives, providing the relevant data to the data consumers is important. Data archives use keywords to define a study. These keywords are mostly chosen from the available set of controlled vocabularies (CVs) in the form of Thesauri. Sometimes the data producers, unable to find suitable keywords for their study use their own keywords, called user-defined keywords. User-defined keywords on one hand solves data producers&rsquo; problems, but on the other hand poses a challenge for the data archive to make data findable for future data consumers. One such example is GESIS Search. GESIS Search is a web-portal which provides a platform to find surveys and social science research data. Users can query the research data based on metadata fields like Topic, Author and many more. In this paper, we focus on Topic field to make the research data more findable. However, the user defined keywords in the Topic field acts as hinderance to data findability. Therefore, the role of assigning CVs to user-defined keywords is crucial to solve this challenge. Manually assigning CVs to user-defined keywords costs a majority of resources and time. We aim to employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to automate the process of broader-term assignment from CVs, improving the findability along the way for the studies in GESIS Search.</p>"

With the FAIR Principles as common ground, we explore the current system of government information dissemination within the United States to see how FAIR Principles can be applicable to the complex ecosystem of federal government information.</p>
<p>Following the guidance of the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), federal agencies increasingly take into consideration FAIR Principles as part of practices to improve public access to federally-supported research data. However, information that has been produced by the government for public access also includes publications, websites, databases, and other forms of content, nearly all of which are now born-digital. Dissemination is subject to the guidelines of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), but once it is published online, stewardship falls to a myriad of responsible agencies, depending on the specifics of the content. This leaves gaps in what is collected, described, made available, and preserved for future discovery and reuse.</p>

,Linda Detterman,,,,,,Promoting AI and Data Literacy at an Academic Library,"<p>While machine learning has been used in libraries and higher education in different ways for several years, the rapid and growing availability of AI tools has brought the term AI to the forefront of many conversations. Librarians at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Library developed a response to promote AI and data literacy both within the library and the UCR community in general. Starting by leading an ongoing internal library discussion group - AI Intersection with Higher Education and the Academic Library - we developed an informal collaborative space to share ideas, concerns, experiences, and self-educate on the impact of AI on our work. This positioned the library within the larger campus to contribute to the response to AI tools, and provided a foundation for AI literacy workshops, which focused on fundamental knowledge of AI with emphasis on consumer level tools. The co-leads were especially mindful to include ethical implications, highlighting possible benefits and harms of AI tools. This poster will describe our experiences and challenges developing these initiatives. We will also highlight feedback from colleagues and learners, and share our future plans.</p>"

The challenge of preserving work in this format looms large, however, as the retirement date for the ""classic"" version of the platform approaches. The presentation describes an effort undertaken at the University of Minnesota to contact authors for hundreds of public-facing story maps. It reflects on the difficulty of managing scholarly outputs in a system not primarily designed for that purpose and of representing web-based work within the library record.</p>"
,Lynda Kellam,Deborah Yun Caldwell,,,,,Using GIS for Historical Data Rescue and Digitalization in Libraries: The 1961 & 1971 Canadian Census Subdivisions & Counties Project,"<p>Digitization of massive volumes of print publications held in libraries and archives contains valuable historical government information such as embedded facts, figures, data, tables, maps, reports, documentation, code, and more. Over the past two decades, various projects have undertaken large-scale &lsquo;digitalization&rsquo; of historical, pre-digital Censuses of Canada. For the Census of Canada modern era, there are two main gaps that remain for the 1961 and 1971 Censuses corresponding to local governments (municipalities), counties, and equivalent units in municipally unincorporated areas. These units are called Census Subdivisions (CSDs) and are nested within Census Divisions (CDs). Extraction of census data and boundaries using geographic information systems (GIS) supports data rescue and enables broad discovery and reuse across research disciplines. This poster will outline a project to &lsquo;digitalize&rsquo; the CSD boundaries for 1961 and 1971 using the best available reference materials and leveraging previous and newly digitized sources, including digitized print source maps, and then, using GIS to draw and assign each CSD polygon with the appropriate ID code and name to match with available data sources.</p>"
,Madiareni Sulaiman,,,,,,Navigating the future of data sharing: The impact and cost of expanded public access requirements,"<p>Updates to US Federal government policies requiring public access to federally funded research are prompting concerns over the cost and effort required to meet expanded public access requirements. Funders&rsquo; policies typically allow researchers to include the costs associated with providing public access in their grant proposal budgets. Invest in Open Infrastructure&rsquo;s research seeks to shed light on what constitutes &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; cost for providing public access to data and publications. We will present quantitative findings on the characteristics of datasets arising from US federally funded research, and summarize available information on the cost of providing data sharing services along with the price those services charge to researchers or their institutions. Finally, we will share our approach to and preliminary results from qualtitative research with stakeholder groups: researchers and their institutions, repositories, and scholarly societies. For each actor in the system, we seek to understand their plans, workflows, decision points, and concerns with respect to the evolving requirements. While this project takes a US focus, the findings are of broad potential interest as the practice of open science and research data sharing are referenced in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, and subject to numerous national research funder policies around the world.</p>"
,Madison Golden,,,,,,Love notes to our future selves: Digital preservation and data curation,"<p>As the volume of research data grows in both size and complexity, concerns about maintaining access to files that are difficult (or impossible) to migrate, reliant on software that is not openly available or no longer accessible, or of such poor quality that they cannot be reused are heightened by an awareness of the environmental cost of digital storage. While archivists have a long history of practice guiding preservation decision-making and the deaccessioning or removal of records from archives, it is not clear how widely archival appraisal theory informs the approach to research data (Dorey, Hurley, and Knazook 2022).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Long-term preservation of digital research data will prove challenging for repositories and preservationists, requiring substantially more information than is typically collected to support decisions about what to keep, how to maintain accessibility, and for how long. Preservationists need information about when the files were created, by whom, and using what software or tools, along with an understanding of the relevance of the data to the community of practice and its perceived long-term value. Curators play a critical role in communicating the informational value of datasets, and through their work with depositors, are in a unique position to collect information that will inform preservation decisions and reduce duplication of effort as data are (re)appraised over time, but they are often disconnected from preservation decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In this panel discussion, we explore how training data curators in archival appraisal can help ensure long-term access to research data. We will hear an overview of a combined data curation and preservation workflow, and 3 institutions will discuss their experiences testing and refining a checklist developed at the Digital Research Alliance of Canada to record appraisal information about incoming datasets. We will end with a panel discussion and share a public version of the checklist.</p>"
,Maggie Marchant,Jeff Belliston,,,,,Reproducibility through Identifiers: Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for research facilities and instruments,"<p>Assigning Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) to facilities and instruments allows data users to better understand how and where data is created, facilitating reproducibility and broadening discoverability and attribution for the facilities and instruments themselves. In light of the fragmentation of the open-science ecosystem, a community-based coordinated approach is necessary to ensure PIDs for facilities and instruments are adopted in ways that provide the widest benefits to everyone involved in the research landscape. It is particularly important for the social and geospatial data communities to participate in this effort as social and geospatial researchers increasingly collaborate with colleagues in the natural sciences to generate and use complex datasets produced by capital-intensive facilities and instruments.<br><br>This presentation will introduce findings from the first year of activities conducted by the FAIR Facilities and Instruments project (funded by the American National Science Foundation&rsquo;s FAIR Open Science Research Coordination Network) to bring together communities from a range of disciplines and roles and to identify use cases such as allowing facilities and instruments to be connected to other entities like data sets, researchers, organizations, articles, grants, and more. Activities included multiple online focus groups with various communities and an in-person workshop that convened experts from around the USA to discuss motivations for and barriers to PID adoption, as well as realistic near-term actions to pursue. Project findings to date represent an important step on the path to incorporating facility and instrument PIDs into the wider data ecosystem and developing community-based recommendations and best practices for research transparency and reproducibility in the next generation of interdisciplinary geospatial and social scientific research.</p>"

,Marla Hertz,,,,,,Measuring Gender Diversity in Library Collections and Publications Using OCLC Metadata,"<p><span>Metadata associated with countries&rsquo; publications and library collections across time and topics can help explore the evolution of the diversity of contributors within a field of study and library patrons&rsquo; ability to access information by diverse groups of authors. The reasons are simple. First, given that publications disseminate knowledge within fields of inquiry, the author/creator metadata associated with the works provide rich snapshots of individuals working within the field.&nbsp; Second, holdings of different types of libraries within a country (e.g., national libraries, research libraries, public libraries, etc.) over time reflect changes in the acquisition policies and preferences and demographic characteristics of their users. Gender diversity in library collections helps expand viewpoints, promote dialogue, and advance research. Our paper mines OCLC&rsquo;s WorldCat metadata to explore how publication and acquisition patterns have evolved for materials created by authors of different genders over time, across fields and different types of libraries within and across countries. This is accomplished by applying tools to infer genders of authors for materials in our sample, and combining this information with: (1) country of publication, (2) field of inquiry identified using the records&rsquo; classification codes, (3) date(s) of publication, (4) language(s) associated with the works and their translations, and (5) the number of libraries by major type in different countries holding the material within their collections. Metrics created from this analysis help answer the following questions. First, how has the gender composition of publications across fields changed over time on a global scale and at the country level? Second, how well do the different collections of various library types reflect the diversity of the materials available? The investigation provides important insights into the current level of diversity reflected along the dimensions of discipline, jurisdiction, and library type, ultimately identifying gaps in coverage.&nbsp;</span></p>"
,Martin Chandler,,,,,,Evolving Data Ecosystem at an Academic Library,"<p>In this world where the lake of available data is becoming an ocean, libraries need to support their researchers as they navigate government mandates and the future of data. At our library, we decided it was crucial to increase our data services to better support researchers as they meet funder requirements, delve into open science, and improve data skills.  This poster depicts the data service ecosystem we created, showcasing how pre-existing support, new services, and our goals for the future come together to create a web that supports the entire data lifecycle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In previous years, our data services focused on offering support in bibliometrics, open scholarship, and geospatial data. In the past year, we have expanded by creating a new data management and sharing support service and introducing new workshop offerings. These workshops range in topics from reproducibility, to metadata, AI, ArcGIS and mapping, and funder policies, culminating with a successful series on data visualizations. Finally, we supported our researchers with new software &ndash; launching a data and institutional repository and purchasing and supporting an electronic laboratory notebook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our plan is to continue this momentum by expanding our data team with two inaugural positions, reproducibility librarian and data curator. This will help us offer tailored learning opportunities, design materials that cater to changing funder requirements, and explore additional research/data platforms. We are also building on partnerships with units across campus that work in synergistic areas including groups that specialize in graduate education, research, and open scholarship. This strategy includes bolstering our marketing efforts and increasing the visibility of our services. In addition, AI and machine learning are closely related to data, and we have a working group devising an AI recommendation for libraries.  &nbsp;</p>

,Martin Rechtorik,,,,,,Checklist for Appraising Research Data for Long-term Preservation,"<p>The checklist (v1) presented here was designed to accompany the appraisal guidance published by members of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's Preservation Expert Group in 2022,&nbsp;<a href=""../records/5942236"">Appraisal Guidance for the Preservation of Research Data.</a> It was developed specifically to aid curators and preservation staff at the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) in assessing the long-term preservation potential of data deposited in the repository, and it is available in both English and French.</p>
<p>A modified checklist (v2) was presented at the IASSIST Conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia in May 2024. These changes were made in response to: a review of the checklist's use over a 2 year period at FRDR, from feedback gathered from an appraisal checklist workshop co-hosted by the Alliance and the Data Curation Network on Sept. 9, 2022, and potential use cases from repositories in the US and Ireland.</p>

,Matthew Murray 🦇,,,,,,Broad Consent for Secondary Use of Data: Students and the Consent Process,"<p>Participant consent for the secondary use of research data is a crucial element of the data lifecycle, and should be an important consideration in data curation and repository management practices. Canadian federal research ethics guidelines include numerous categories of information that should be provided to potential participants in order to establish that consent for unknown future uses of data, or broad consent, is informed. The volume of information conveyed during the consent process raises questions about participant engagement with and comprehension of the terms of consent and whether alternatives to written formats might be preferred by participants. To examine these questions, an anonymous survey was distributed to students at a Canadian undergraduate university designed to explore: how deeply students engage with consent information; whether a brief video describing procedures for, benefits, and risks of open data influences decisions to opt in or out of an open dataset; and whether those decisions are consistent with behaviours toward privacy and information security in other contexts. Preliminary results demonstrate low levels of engagement with the consent process; ineffectiveness of an explanatory video; largely altruistic motivations for participation in anonymous, open research; and attitudes toward personal data protection that are highly context-dependent. Further research in this area could support improvements to the open data consent process to add clarity and increase trust in research data management and sharing processes, and inform the development of institutional and repository policies around ethical data sharing.</p>"
,Maureen Haaker,,,,,,Documenting Reproducibility: The Integral Role of Documentation in Transparent Qualitative Research,"<p><span>An international drive for open data has been growing since the early 2000s to promote greater reproducibility within research. This has culminated in Wilkinson&rsquo;s et al (2016) guidelines for FAIR data. As these calls for reproducibility and FAIR data are codified in data policies and publishing ethics, it raises difficult questions for qualitative researchers for how transparency can be consistently and ethically demonstrated within their projects. Using observations and findings from a systematic review of over 1000 qualitative collections held at the UK Data Service, this presentation presents an archive&rsquo;s point-of-view of how innovative ways of documenting data and new curation tools can provide support for demonstrating process and analytic transparency in qualitative research. I outline key ways that good practices in data management and curation support transparency, as well enhanced ways that go further in showing research integrity. As part of this discussion, I introduce exemplary case studies from the UK Data Service&rsquo;s collections and qualitative-specific tools developed at the UK Data Service which exemplify the core principles of transparency and reproducibility in qualitative research. Reflecting on the recent developments in curation, this presentation offers qualitative researchers new possibilities for constructively responding to calls for reproducibility, as well as providing further guidance on how policies and procedures might take into account the specific needs of qualitative data.</span></p>"
,Meg Miller,Grace O'Hanlon,,,,,Enhancing Data Governance in Trusted Research Environments,"<p>Trusted Research Environments have been pivotal in facilitating secure and ethical access for research to data deemed too sensitive or detailed to be shared outside of their secure enclaves. The increased availability of these data has facilitated vital research that can benefit our society. But these data come with risk and a TREs role is to mitigate this. Previously much of the focus of our data governance has been on preventing the re-identification of data subjects, maintaining an excellent track record in confidentiality breaches. However, in recent years we have seen the data landscape changing rapidly, with a wide array of new data types and analytical methods. This changing landscape brings new possibilities for harms which extend beyond simple re-identification. With this changing landscape, it&rsquo;s time to re-evaluate our data governance to ensure we can continue to protect those who trust us with their data. This presentation will focus on work at TREs such as the Secure Data Center in Germany to review, re-evaluate and improve our data governance frameworks. This work utilises the Five Safes framework to steer the development of technical infrastructure, new training and the redefining of projects to ensure that we can ensure safe and ethical data use in a changing world.</p>"
,Megan Chenoweth,Lindsay Gypin,,,,,The Role of FAIR Principles in High-Quality Research Data Documentation,"<p>The FAIR principles as a framework for evaluating and improving open science and research data management have gained much attention over the last years. By defining a set of properties that indicates good practice for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), a quality measurement is created, which can be applied to many research outputs, including research data. There are some software tools available to help with the assessment, with the F-UJI tool being the most prominent of them. It uses a set of metrics which defines tests for each of the FAIR components, and it creates an overall assessment score. The FAIR assessment is done by using aggregated metadata for a research dataset, e.g. from the data webpage URL, from a PID provider like DataCite and others, and more services like repository information by re3data. The presentation will examine differences between manually and automatically assessing FAIR principles, show the different results, and use Election Studies and COVID data studies as examples. It will highlight the role of archives in securing a high level of data and metadata quality and technically sound implementation of the FAIR principles to help researchers benefit from getting the most of their valuable research data.</p>"
,Melanie Brasher,Skye Leedahl,,,,,Metadata Augmentation for Social Science Datasets Using Generative AI,"<p>Efficiently curating metadata with controlled terminology is a critical yet time-consuming task in social science data management and archiving. Data depositors often provide insufficient metadata, compelling data repository staff to extensively enhance the metadata. This process traditionally involves navigating a wide array of controlled terms, a task demanding substantial time and expertise, sometimes necessitating the creation of new terms.<br>Addressing these challenges, we introduce an innovative model employing Generative AI technology (ChatGPT). This tool is engineered to significantly diminish the time required for metadata curation for data repository staff while enhancing the accuracy of term matching. It achieves this by rapidly analyzing text and extracting pertinent keywords from established thesauri, including the ICPSR Subject Thesaurus, the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), and Library of Congress Subject Headings (LC SH), along with ChatGPT's intelligent recommendations. This approach not only expedites the curation process but also ensures heightened precision and recall in the results.</p>"
,Melinda Kernik,,,,,,Envisioning Ethical Frameworks for Community-Data,"<p>Emerging funder and journal requirements for research data management impact community-engaged research. In Canada, the Tri-Agency&rsquo;s RDM Policy prompted changes to their Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, enabling &ldquo;broad consent&rdquo; for data sharing. Across the border, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation are enacting new protocols for data management and sharing.</p>
<p>While sensitive data management is an active discussion in academic circles, researched communities are not yet included. Community organizations collect and manage data and often act as intermediaries in human-participant research that produces sensitive data but do so in different ways than university researchers. These groups and their constituents stand to benefit from guidelines to help alleviate over-research, surveillance, and damage-centered narratives.</p>
<p>Our IASSIST presentation will discuss insights and strategies gained from the RDM Community Data Toolkits Workshop on March 21-22, 2024. This two-day event will bring together researchers and information specialists alongside social justice organizations and non-profits to develop toolkits to better navigate the critical ethics of community research data. Discussions will ensure:</p>
<p>&bull; Data can be utilized by communities themselves in ways that serve their specific targets and metrics for change as conceived by their own determinants of need and designs for betterment. Community-led data practices empower and support community-led grassroots actions and initiatives. &bull; Research data from communities is protected and does not make them vulnerable and/or grant them visibility, safeguarding their susceptibility to data misuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>With the community-engaged interventions we hope to establish a framework to continue working on these toolkits beyond the workshop. By sharing these insights with the IASSIST community, we hope to assist researchers and information specialists who may also be working with community data and/or organizations, as well as find potential collaborators on future projects following this theme</p>"

,Meryl Brodsky,Grant Hardaway,Hannah Chapman Tripp,,,,Exploring the Use of Text as Data in Political Science,"<p>In political science, as in other social sciences, the rise of text mining &ldquo;has vastly broadened the scope of questions that can be investigated empirically&rdquo; (Benoit, p. 461). As a political science librarian supporting a department with an emphasis on computational methods, I have encountered a steady rise in questions from researchers looking to use a variety of textual data sources. These range from whether library books can be digitized for computational analysis, to whether our existing databases allow for automated searching and bulk downloading, to requests for new licensed resources for text mining. Additionally, recent changes to the social media data landscape, such as the monetization of the Twitter API, are shaking up researchers&rsquo; approaches for finding and accessing data, causing them to turn to the library for guidance.<br><br>To better understand the specific needs and challenges of political science researchers using text mining methods, I conducted an analysis of recent dissertations from top political science programs. Specifically, I looked at what types of sources are used for text mining, how these sources are accessed, what challenges researchers encounter in working with large-scale textual data, and how libraries are involved in supporting this work. In this presentation I will highlight findings from this study, discuss how they have informed the way I and others at my institution are supporting text mining in the social sciences, and consider implications for libraries as we navigate the future of text as data.<br><br>Works Cited.<br><br>Benoit, K.

<p>The University has also adopted a data management policy based on the FAIR principles, which states the fundamental principle that data from research and environmental monitoring and assessment should be as open as possible. While there was already plenty of open data when work began on trying to make the university's open EMA data more reusable, there were also some noticeable gaps. In 2021, it was therefore decided to create a metadata catalogue for open environmental monitoring and assessment data, SLU's environmental data catalogue.</p>
<p>With the creation and subsequent launch of SLU's environmental data catalogue in 2022, the EMA data has become easier to find and can be reused to a greater extent than before.</p>"

,Mikala Narlock,Sophia Lafferty-Hess,,,,,The Illinois Data Purchase Program: Journey's End / New Horizons,"<p>The Data Purchase Program (DPP) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) was one of the earliest formalized programs for data collection development based on requests from researchers. Beginning in 2011, the DPP successfully made targeted acquisitions of numerical and geospatial datasets on behalf of UIUC graduate students and faculty. However, each new dataset acquisition presented its own unique challenges, and a variety of approaches for storage, discovery, and access (in accord with vendor requirements) were tested and implemented with mixed success. In addition, over the eleven years of the program, researchers' expectations regarding the DPP's budget, speed, and ongoing support began to exceed the DPP's scope, while data vendors became more sophisticated in their offerings and options. Waves of challenges--in acquiring data our researchers wanted, in maintaining the collection we already had, and in maintaining the personnel needed to support the collection--overwhelmed the DPP, and the program was discontinued in 2022. This poster will discuss the territories the DPP explored, the lessons learned, and how those lessons can inform future expeditions in data collection development, storage, discovery and access at Illinois and beyond.</p>"
,Nadia Kennar,,,,,,Lowering Barriers to Incorporating Geospatial Data into Social Science Research: The National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA),"<p>Research in the social sciences and public health has shed light on the many influences of the physical, built, and social environment on health and wellbeing. Increasingly, researchers are turning to geospatial data sources to measure these phenomena. Researchers exploring social science questions about place are experts in their fields, but may be novice&nbsp; users of GIS tools and technologies. They may face many challenges when working with geospatial data, including: lack of access to geospatial datasets, a need for large amounts of storage space and computing power, and a steep learning curve for the tools and programming languages used to work with geospatial data.</p>
<p>The National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA) aims to address these challenges for users in the United States by providing geographic information in a simpler, easy-to-use, and publicly available format. NaNDA is an open data repository. It was created to facilitate research on the relationship between neighborhoods and health, especially within the context of large federally funded surveys and cohort studies. NaNDA reduces barriers to incorporating spatial data into social science research in three ways. First, NaNDA makes the data available in familiar tabular formats that can easily be linked to other data sources about individuals and communities. Second, NaNDA data promotes reproducibility and speeds up the research process by making the finished version of measures available instead of multiple users having to create the same measures from scratch. Third, NaNDA data is both publicly available for anyone to download from ICPSR, and increasingly available at the point of use in other enclaves, such as the Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA) and the Michigan Medicine DataDirect portal. For these reasons, NaNDA serves as a model for geographic data services of the future.</p>"

Initially created with the support of a National Science Foundation grant in 1999, the Bibliography captures and documents the usage of ICPSR data in research and publications. It helps people discover data and gauge its potential utility. Now housing over 110,000 data-linked citations, the Bibliography&rsquo;s database continues to be expanded by librarians and information professionals who actively fish through research output, both published and unpublished, to find instances of ICPSR data usage. If a publication meets the Bibliography&rsquo;s collection criteria, the publication is displayed with the research study&rsquo;s record on ICPSR&rsquo;s websites. By equipping people with a compass to discover and evaluate the value of the thousands of social science datasets held by ICPSR, the Bibliography provides &ldquo;wealth from the sea&rdquo; of data.</p>"
,Nicole Emmenegger,,,,,,How Online Training Events are Supporting the Development of Quantitative Data Skills in Social Science Students: a qualitative research project,"<p>There is international demand for quantitative data skills &ndash; with Governments increasingly concerned with how data skills are acquired for 21st Century jobs. There is evidence from data skills training initiatives that social science students can help to fill this gap (Carter, 2021a, 2021b; Tazzyman et al., 2021) but more data skills training is needed to fulfil this need. The purpose of this paper is to explore how online training events can support social science students to develop data skills. We present results from a qualitative research project using in-depth interviews with social science students who have participated in UK Data Service (UKDS) online training events. We use reflective thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke 2021) to explore how the training enhances their data literacy and helps them acquire skills that they can use in their studies and research careers. We also discuss how the results from the project are feeding back into developments in the UKDS data skills training programme.</p>"

In the ensuing 20 years, we&rsquo;ve seen a proliferation of data literacy initiatives in higher education (often as a supplement to&mdash;and sometimes conflated with&mdash;the emergence of data science and data analytics as an academic discipline and an in-demand career path).<br><br>Harkening back to Schield&rsquo;s focus on the library, we want to explore the extent to which these burgeoning endeavors are centered in the library and staffed and maintained by librarians. Additionally, we hope to quantify, as of now, at what type of institution the library is most likely to take the lead in promoting data literacy.<br><br>This poster will present initial findings from a comparison of data literacy initiatives at large research universities in North America (ARL members) with data literacy programs at undergraduate-focused liberal arts colleges in the same region. Other variables considered include the marketing and discoverability of data literacy programs; the involvement of other non-library campus units; the extent of data literacy training and instruction (including a for-credit option); and the focus and content of data literacy programs. Attendees&rsquo; reaction to these initial findings will help inform the path and direction of further lines of inquiry related to this topic.</p>"
,Paul Colin,Alina Danciu,Guillaume Garcia,,,,Modernizing Data-Delivery Technologies - Combining Data-User Feedback with User-Support Expertise for Successful Data Tools,"<p>Navigating the future of data ultimately relies on technology that assists would-be data users to discover, evaluate, and analyze data, and to do so quickly. ICPSR began sharing social sciences data electronically by FTP(!) in 1996 and via the Web in 1998; authentication technology that enabled members to download member-data directly via the web launched in 2001. In tech-time, this is ancient history!<br><br>Over the last two years, ICPSR has been modernizing its data ingest and data delivery platforms. It&rsquo;s not done yet, but lessons have already been learned!<br><br>How does a 60+ year-old archive with a legacy of ingest, curation, dissemination, and specially-developed data technologies united together and interconnected in known and unknown ways reimagine and relaunch itself to meet research-data-sharing needs of today and of the future? The answer seems simple - talk to those &ldquo;using&rdquo; the data technologies. But then it gets complicated quickly. Who is a data user? Who else has key information that must be included? How does an organization combine user and user-support feedback, expert knowledge, and regulations to assist tech developers in navigating the future of research-data-sharing technology?<br><br>Don&rsquo;t worry - this poster isn&rsquo;t going to be tech-talk! Rather, it&rsquo;s going to be data-user-talk including how to identify and talk with users of data delivery technologies and importantly, about the necessity of getting direction from those interacting with or assisting data users. There will be colorful process charts, a summary of lessons-learned, and some peeks at ICPSR&rsquo;s recently-launched/about-to-launch data delivery technologies! The information will be of interest to those interested in (user-friendly) data service technologies and those who help data users navigate the processes to find or deposit scientific data.</p>"
,Reyna Jenkyns,,,,,,Meeting new challenges posed by the UK Censuses,"<p>This paper builds on and extends a presentation at IASSIST2023 which outlined the challenges faced in disseminating data from the 2021/2022 Censuses in the United Kingdom, as part of the UK Data Service (UKDS). The UKDS is a key part of UK research infrastructure, and provides a wide range of social sciences, humanities, and economic research data with census data being one of the major collections.</p>
<p>A range of tools have been developed within UKDS to provide access to data, and these continue to be extended. New workflows exist for aggregate data and for origin-destination data &ndash; the latter being addressed in detail in a separate submission to this conference. In this paper we illustrate the full set of current tools, explain how they can be used, and showcase examples of analysis. Census data are disseminated with a variety of license arrangements: open, safeguarded, and secure, and we reflect on shifting balances of risk appetite, and what this means for researchers, including those based outside the UK.</p>
<p>We also reflect more broadly on long-standing and new challenges faced in disseminating this data: the size and complexity of the resulting outputs; user expectations; new competitors etc. The 2021 census round in the UK was notable for a number of reasons: operational changes enforced by the covid-19 pandemic including deferment in Scotland, new questions and legal challenges to question and guidance wording. The wider context is a public consultation over the future of population and migration data collection in the UK, with the possibility that the 2021 census will also turn out to have the last such census, and thus we also reflect on how we can adapt a census archive/service to a future 'administrative based census' archive/service, with more frequent data about which researchers may be less aware.</p>"
,Ryan Womack,Aizada Arystanbek,,,,,Unpacking Inter-dependent Considerations  Associated with Selecting Data for Reuse as Part of the Discovery Process,"<p>This presentation reports preliminary findings from an interview study conducted at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). We present insights from 20 semi-structured interviews of secondary data users about data search, reuse, and recommendation. We conducted interviews as part of a larger study for a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project. Academic literature shows varied data discovery practices among scientists are the norm (e.g., Gregory et al., 2020). Our NSF-sponsored work (e.g., Lafia et al., 2023) confirms this finding, but much less understood is how inter-dependencies among information needs, data types, and user contexts (to name a few factors) create variable data discovery behaviors (and why).<br><br>We classify interviews using a structured codebook (Salda&ntilde;a, 2011) to understand why data discovery at ICPSR is varied. Our interviews related to data discovery behavior from a variety of angles. Our presentation focuses on the search process (i.e., looking for data to meet an information need) and data reuse (i.e., processes after users find relevant data that may lead them to search for additional data or information to complete a study). We show how our interview passages align with search paths we previously identified (Lafia et al., 2023) and that considerations tied to doing research produce variability in data discovery. We conclude data discovery occurs in an ecosystem extending beyond individual data archives and repositories, which further increases variation in discovery behavior.</p>"
,Sandra Sawchuk,Alexandra Cooper,,,,,Building a Community: Crafting Specialized Curriculum for Data Curation,"<p>Data curation is the process of making data understandable and reusable for publication within a data repository. It can be multifaceted and complex based on the types of data you are curating and the expertise of the curator; and with evolving data sharing practices and standards, ensuring data curators and stewards have access to high-quality instruction on specific data types is essential for supporting the goals of data sharing. Duke University, in collaboration with members of the Data Curation Network (DCN), received an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant [re-252343-ols-22] to support the development of specialized curriculum for data curation training for academic library and archives staff. The project drew together data curators and information professionals to create in-depth training resources for four specialized data types: geospatial data, scientific images, code, and simulations. Building upon the CURATE(D) workflow, the project employed a community-driven cohort approach to develop the new curriculum materials, which were piloted at a 2-day in-person workshop in October 2023. In this presentation we will discuss how this curriculum complements existing DCN training initiatives, the approach to curriculum development, the core content that was developed, plans for dissemination, and reflections on the project.</p>"
,Sebastian Karcher,Julia G. Bottesini,,,,,Anchoring qualitative research support: two university library case studies,"<p>Qualitative research is fundamental to the social sciences but has historically sailed in the shadow of, and received less support than, quantitative research. In her pioneering study of the nascent state of qualitative supports in academic libraries, Swygart-Hobaugh (2016) even dubbed them the 'Jan Brady' of data services. As qualitative researchers, and leaders of research data services and social science support units at our respective libraries, we recognize this and believe our organizations are well positioned to support qualitative researchers throughout the research lifecycle.</p>
<p>This poster will showcase our experiences establishing new qualitative research support services at Temple University Libraries and the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. We will discuss how we developed or restarted our services, from initial benchmarking and internal exploration to service launch, team staffing, and evaluation.</p>
<p>Our two case studies demonstrate practical applications of suggestions made by past researchers, who have explored the visibility and accessibility of qualitative research support and the relationship between qualitative support, data literacy, and other research data services (Swygart-Hobaugh, 2016; Cain et al., 2019; Hagman &amp; Bussell, 2022).</p>"
,Shawn Nicholson,Terrence Bennett,,,,,The Nova Scotia Open Data Portal: Findings from User Research and Engagement with its Community,"<p>The principles of transparency and accountability are important to the Government of Nova Scotia. The Nova Scotia Open Data Portal plays a key role in supporting these principles by hosting government datasets made available by various departments. However, to meet the demands and expectations for access to government data, insight into the needs of and the use of data and open data by the public, including, for example, librarians, researchers, students, entrepreneurs, and interested citizens, is vital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User research was conducted in the Fall of 2023 to understand the needs and experiences of Nova Scotia Open Data Portal users and potential users and to find opportunities for future and continuous engagement. This presentation will describe the user research findings from an online survey, focus groups, and interviews as well as subsequent plans and efforts to support the Nova Scotia open data community and engage meaningfully.</p>"
,Shelby Hallman,Renee Romero,Ashley Peterson,Hannah Sutherland,,,Wealth of Metadata with DDI,"<p>Documentation of research data across the research data lifecycle requires metadata at several stages. The DDI metadata standard provides several products across the data lifecycle to facilitate the capture and use of structured metadata. DDI products allow for both human- and machine-interactions with the documentation. They include DDI-Codebook for entry-level cataloguing; DDI-Lifecycle and Controlled Vocabularies for reusability and more sophisticated descriptions of surveys, questions and instruments; the XKOS extension to the Simple Knowledge Organization System for rich conceptual metadata; and the Structured Data Transformation Language (SDTL) for provenance. In addition, DDI-Cross Domain Integration (DDI-CDI) is a leading-edge product intended to fill the emerging need for integration of data from different disciplinary domains such as health or environmental sciences. The poster will show how the DDI products work together and contribute to researcher&rsquo;s needs for high quality documentation and data and metadata re-use.</p>"

,Spencer Samuel,,,,,,Developments in Data Governance at the US Department of Labor,"<p>The US Department of Labor (DOL) contains many agencies which are broken into 3 groups: administration, policy, and enforcement. The Bureau of Labor Statistics sits alone outside this basic framework. These DOL agencies produce data, but this activity is not the main focus of their work. This has consequences, as discoverability, quality, understanding, interoperability, and the ability to blend data are not optimized.</p>
<p>The Office of Data Governance (ODG) at DOL was established and resolved to address these issues. The task for the office is to develop a framework for good data governance at DOL and set a path towards building the capabilities to maintain it. All this is to be done with a small staff and very little budget.</p>
<p>The focus of this talk will be on the 5 enforcement agencies at DOL: EBSA (benefits), MSHA (mine safety), OFCCP (federal contracts), OSHA (occupational safety), and WHD (wages). Enforcement is somewhat of a misnomer, as the main interest of the agencies is to gain compliance with their laws and regulations. When an inspection occurs and violations are found, the efforts of the agencies are to bring the violating establishments into compliance. The efforts are not to punish, though fines are sometimes necessary.</p>
<p>With the exception of mining, inspections occur when a violation is suspected at some establishment. So, the data are not representative of a larger population, and the data are mostly hand entered. As would be expected, problems arise from this situation.</p>
<p>In the talk, we will describe the program being developed by ODG.</p>"
,Stephanie Labou,,,,,,Metadata Ahoy! Charting a reusable path for machine learning,"<p>Machine learning (ML) is more popular than ever, but what is needed to best document, curate, and archive ML research outputs? Data curators are largely in uncharted waters as to what extent repositories are able to manage ML objects and components (data, code, parameters, documentation, etc.) in a way that matches researcher needs and uses. But before we can plot a course towards a set of best practices, we must first ask: where are we now?<br><br>This presentation will provide an overview of a recent research project that assessed how well metadata schema and fields in eight generalist (Figshare, Zenodo, Harvard Dataverse, etc.) and specialist repositories facilitate findability, interoperability, and reusability of ML objects. We will discuss strengths of and opportunities for these repositories, and what generalist repositories can learn from specialist repositories and vice versa. The presentation will also summarize the outputs from this project, all of which are publicly available: a multi-repository metadata field crosswalk, complete metadata exports of nearly 20,000 ML-related items from these repositories, and user interface and code to query repository APIs and standardize and analyze metadata exports. We hope the IASSIST community will dive deep into this bounty of (meta)data!</p>"
,Talya Cooper,,,,,,DDI Training Materials: A Metadata Management Training Resource,"<p>The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an international standard for describing the data produced by surveys and other observational methods in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences. DDI is a free standard that can document and manage different stages in the research data lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DDI training materials provide an introduction to metadata and DDI, to those who are new to DDI - from the basics of &lsquo;What is Metadata?&rsquo; to more detailed subjects like &lsquo;Variables and the Variable Cascade&rsquo;. They can be used for your own individual training to gain an understanding of different aspects of DDI, or re-used when developing training activities.</p>
<p>The training materials were developed by the DDI Alliance Training Working Group (DDI TWG), whose mission involves introducing people to DDI and improving people's competence in working with DDI. The resources have been published in the Zenodo community DDI Training Materials (<a href=""../communities/ddi_training_material"">https://zenodo.org/communities/ddi_training_material</a>) in the form of presentations, and include a guide for how to use them. In addition, efforts are being made to translate several presentations into various languages.</p>
<p>The poster was created for the IASSIST 2024 conference and describes the DDI Training resources and how to use them for your own or others learning.</p>

,Wolfgang Zenk-Möltgen,,,,,,Librarian teach thyself: Exploring natural language processing tools for de-identification as window into AI for librarians,"<p>This poster will present a project that helped librarians learn and teach artificial intelligence (AI) tools for data de-identification. Librarians continue to play an important role in research data management services, offering crucial outreach and instruction to faculty and researchers about data tools, FAIR data, and open science. As AI tools continue to grow in use and popularity, information professionals are poised to offer guidance on data sharing in the AI landscape. Training librarians to train researchers in AI concepts and AI-based data tools helps increase librarian skills in both AI and data management. Data de-identification is a great example of a data management skill that is well suited to AI-based tools. Therefore, this one-hour webinar was created to introduce librarians and information professionals to AI and natural language processing (NLP), and provide fundamental context about how they work through the example of de-identification.</p>
<p>Using a train-the-trainer model, this class explored openly available tools that use NLP to find and redact personally identifying information, and discussed the distinctions between privacy, de-identification, anonymization, and (USA-specific) HIPAA compliance. The removal and de-identification of personal and sensitive information is often a repetitive, time intensive process. These tools can be used to produce HIPAA compliant data that can be more safely shared and help researchers comply with data sharing policies. Teaching librarians about freely available data tools can improve their understanding of AI and expand their institution&rsquo;s data service offerings. Although the workshop presented was focused on librarians, our planning process may be of interest to other trainers interested in introducing AI basics through practical tools. This presentation will describe curriculum development, highlighted tools, and results from a pilot run.</p>"

The presenters will discuss the process of guiding what began as an ad-hoc interest group into a large-scale, multi-faceted team to enable student learning about AI, based on gathered data. The team is co-led by two librarians, and consists of full-time library staff, instructional development staff, and student library workers. The team collaborates on a suite of projects that include: gathering and analyzing data about current use of AI on campus via a pop-up survey; an IRB survey; an interactive tutorial on the ethical use of AI in coursework; an AI tools resource guide; an external, campus workshop addressing algorithmic bias and bias in AI; and an internal, library workshop on AI in library instruction. Attendees will leave with an understanding of the project components; lessons learned; and insight on how the project outputs address diverse student perceptions and needs surrounding generative AI.</p>"
,Zack MacDonald,,,,,,"Progress, Not Perfection: A Workshop Series on Accessible Data Visualization","<p>Data visualization can improve access to and understanding of information to a wider audience. In emergencies, charts and infographics can be used to quickly communicate information and help with decision making. Despite these benefits, inaccessible data visualizations can exclude people from getting the key information they need to understand a topic or to make decisions. Accessibility is a core part of social justice work and should continue to be a critical component of the future of data.</p>
<p>This poster will cover a workshop series at the University of Washington that teaches attendees how to create more accessible visualizations. The workshops emphasize accessibility at the foundation of visualization creation to be more inclusive of all users, and they provide guidance on topics such as screen readers, color and vision, and more.</p>
<p>The next stage of this workshop series is to gather feedback on the content and presentation, then hopefully make the content, including slides and activities, open to anyone who is interested in using the material to work with their own user groups.</p>"
